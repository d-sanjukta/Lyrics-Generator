# Lyrics-Generator
Lyrics generator using LLMs

<b> <u> INTRODUCTION</u> :</b>

  - Lyrics are an essential component of music. Musicians can communicate their ideas, feelings, and experiences to their listeners through lyrics. But creating lyrics can be difficult since it requires a skill set combining creativity, language mastery, and cultural sensitivity. 
  - The recent development in Natural Language Processing over the years has made it possible to generate sentences based on specific prompts. NLP models may analyze and synthesize language in a way that imitates human creativity by utilizing the capabilities of machine learning and computational linguistics.
> OBJECTIVE:
    - The goal of this project is to create a high-caliber, entertaining lyrics generator that can work with a variety of musical genres. 
    - We also want to investigate the many types of lyrics based on genre-specific famous artists through this project.

* Choosen Genres: 
  * Country 
  * Pop 
  * Rhythms and Blues (RB)

  We also chose 5 different artists for each particular genre to fine tune artist specific models.
